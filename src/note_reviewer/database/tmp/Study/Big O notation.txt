Big O notation is a mathematical way to describe how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the size of its input increases. It focuses on the dominant term in a function, ignoring constants and smaller terms, to give a high-level understanding of an algorithm's scalability and efficiency. For instance, if an algorithm has a complexity of o(n)^2
O(n 2), its runtime grows quadratically as the input size increases.

Why It's Crucial
Scalability: Big O helps predict how an algorithm performs with large inputs, which is vital for applications like big data processing or systems with limited resources9.
Efficiency Comparison: It allows developers to compare algorithms and choose the most efficient one for their needs, especially when dealing with constraints like time or memory39.
Resource Management: In resource-limited environments (e.g., mobile apps, embedded systems), understanding Big O ensures optimal use of computational power9.
For example, an O(1)
O(n) algorithm (linear growth) will always scale better than an O(n 2)

O(n 2) algorithm (quadratic growth) as input sizes grow

Common Big O Complexities and Examples
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most common Big O complexities with simple algorithm examples: 1. Constant Time: O(1)

O(1)
The runtime does not depend on the input size.

2. Logarithmic Time: O(log*n)

O(logn)
The input size is reduced by half with each step, such as in binary search.

3. Linear Time: O(n)

O(n)
The runtime scales directly with the input size.

4. Log-Linear Time: O(nlogn)

O(nlogn)
Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort.

5. Quadratic Time: O(n 2)

O(n 2)
Nested loops cause the runtime to grow quadratically with input size.

6. Exponential Time: O(2n)

O(2n)
Runtime doubles with each additional input, often seen in recursive algorithms without optimization.

7. Factorial Time: O(n!)

O(n!)
Occurs in problems that require generating all permutations, such as the traveling salesman problem.
