# React Context vs Redux: Key Differences
## React Context

* Built into React: No additional libraries needed
* Simpler setup: Less boilerplate code
* Best for: Smaller to medium applications, shared state that doesn't change frequently
* Learning curve: Relatively easy to learn and implement
* Updates: Can cause re-renders in components that don't need the updates

## Redux

* Separate library: Requires installation and integration
* More structured: Uses actions, reducers, and a single store
* Best for: Larger applications with complex state management needs
* Learning curve: Steeper, with more concepts to understand
* Updates: More efficient with selective re-rendering
* Dev tools: Excellent debugging tools and time-travel debugging
* Middleware: Robust ecosystem for handling side effects (Redux Thunk, Redux Saga)

### Which Is Better For Your E-commerce Site?
* For your Pink Friday Nails e-commerce project, Context is likely sufficient because:

* Scale: It's a class project with defined scope (not an enterprise application)
* Complexity: The state management needs are relatively straightforward
* Learning curve: You're already learning React and Spring Boot, so simpler state management is beneficial
* Feature set: Your core features (products, cart, authentication) don't require complex state interactions

### Structuring Context to be React-like
