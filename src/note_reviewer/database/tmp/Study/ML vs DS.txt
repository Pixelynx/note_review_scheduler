Steps of ML Project
- Collect Data
- Train Model
 - Iterate many times until good enough
- Deploy Model
 - Get data back
 - Maintain/update model

Steps of DS Project
- Collect Data
- Analyze Data
 - Iterate many times to get good insights
- Suggest hypothesis/actions
 - Deploy changes
 - Reanalyze new data periodically

Ex: DS can be used to optimize a factory line to determine best conditions during manufacturing process to produce merchaindise at a higher quality
Ex: ML can be used to automate visual inspections of a manufacturing line


Choosing AI Project
- Think about automating tasks rather than jobs
- What are the main drivers of business value
- What are the main pain points of your business


Technical Diligence
- Can AI system meet desired performance
- How much data is needed
- Engineering timeline
Business Diligence
- Lower costs
- Increase revenue
- Launch Product or business
Ethical Diligence


Build vs Buy
- ML can be in-house or outsourced
- DS projects are more commonly in-house
- Some thing will be industry standard--avoid building


AI Terms & Data
- Training Set (learning)
- Test Set
* Some AI teams may ask for second test set (Development/validation set)


Pitfall: Expecting 100% Accuracy
- Limitations of ML
- Insufficient Data
- Mislabled Data
- Ambiguous Labels


Building AI in your Company
Case Study: Smart Speaker
- Trigger/Wake word detection -- Audio -> "Hey <DEVICE>?" (0/10)
- Speech recognition -- Audio "Tell me a joke."
- Intent recognition -- "Tell me a <JOKE>."
- Execute intent

AI Pipeline: When you have multiple ML components which process data concurrently

Case Study: Self-Driving Cars
- Image/Radar/Lidar -> Car/Pedestrian detection
- Motion Planning => Steer/Accelerate/Brake

Car Detection/Pedestrian Detection:
- Supervised learning: Input relevant pictures and test output detected cars

Motion Planning 
- Detect & output driving path & speed of road; Detect objects to maneuver around; Trajectory prediction

AI Transformation Playbook
- Exe pilot projects to gain momentum 
- Build in-house AI team
- Provide broad Ai training
- Develop AI strategy
- Develop internal & external communication

Develop AI Strategy
- Leverage Ai to create an advantage specific to your industry sector
 * after you understand how AI can be used to benefit your company *
- Design strategy aligned w. the "Virtuous Cycle of AI"
- Consider creating a data strategy
 - strategic data acquisition 
- Unified data warehouse

Create network effects and platform advantages
- In industries with "winner take all" dynamics, AI can be an accelerator


AI Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't expect Ai to solve everything 
- Don't hire 2-3 ML engineers and count solely on them to come up with use cases
- Don't expect AI project to work first time
- Don't expect traditional planning processes to apply w.o changes
- Don't think you need superstar engineers before you can do anything


Limitations of AI
- Biased AI through biased data
- Adversarial attacks on AI
