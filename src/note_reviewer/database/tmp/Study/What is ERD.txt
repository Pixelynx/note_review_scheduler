ERD stands for "Entity-Relationship Diagram" in this context. It's a crucial database design tool that helps you visualize and plan the data structure for your e-commerce application before you start coding.

## What is an ERD?

An ERD is a flowchart that illustrates how different "entities" (database tables) relate to one another within your system. For your Pink Fridat Nails e-commerce site, your ERD would show:

1. What tables you'll need (Users, Products, Orders, etc.)
2. What fields each table will contain
3. How the tables connect to each other (relationships)
4. The type of relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)

## Why It's Important

For week 1, the project outline specifically asks for an ERD because:

1. It forces you to think through your data structure before writing code
2. It helps identify potential issues with your database design early
3. It serves as a reference when building both your backend and frontend
4. It's a common industry practice in software development

## What Your ERD Should Include

Based on your e-commerce requirements, your ERD should include tables for:

- Users (for authentication)
- Products (nail products/services)
- Categories (product groupings)
- Orders (completed purchases)
- Order_Items (individual items in an order)
- Cart_Items (items in a user's cart)

## Example Relationships

- A User can have many Orders (one-to-many)
- An Order belongs to one User (many-to-one)
- An Order can have many Order_Items (one-to-many)
- A Product can be in many Order_Items (one-to-many)

## Tools to Create ERDs

You can create your ERD using:
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) (has free tier)
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (free)
- [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) (free tier available)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (if using MySQL)
