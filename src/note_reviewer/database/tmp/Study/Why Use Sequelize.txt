Why Use Sequelize?

Sequelize provides several advantages over direct database access:

Database Agnosticism: Works with multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) without changing code

Migrations: Structured way to version control database schema changes

ORM Features: Maps JavaScript objects to database tables, simplifying data manipulation

Validation: Built-in data validation before hitting the database

Security: Protection against SQL injection by parameterizing queries

Portability: The same codebase works across different environments and machines

Consistency: Enforces consistent data access patterns across your application

Setup Steps for a Database with Sequelize:


Install Dependencies
   npm install sequelize sequelize-cli pg pg-hstore

Initialize Sequelize Directory Structure
   npx sequelize-cli init

Configure Database Connection
Create .env file with credentials
Create config.js using environment variables
Set up .sequelizerc to point to this configuration

Create Models
   npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes name:string,email:string

Define Relationships in model files (hasMany, belongsTo, etc.)

Create and Run Migrations
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

Seed Initial Data (optional)
   npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-users
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

Access Database in Code
   const { User } = require('./models');
   const users = await User.findAll();

This approach provides a structured, secure, and portable way to manage your database that can be shared, version-controlled, and deployed across different environments.
